# Disk Analyzer

Disk Analyzer is a command line disk usage utility for mac OS.
Since the upgrade to mac OS 10.15.6 most APIs have changed and software like Disk Inventory X is not working anymore 
so I decided to write my own tool and while it's CLI and only in the beginning it works quite well and scan faster than all of the software I worked with.



## Getting Started
A make file with instruction will be posted in the repository in the upcoming days

After the hard disk scan is done you will have the option to navigate from the root folder and see the sizes of every folder and file in the current directory.
 
**commands**
* `:b` - back to the previous directory
* `:c` - clear screen
* `:q` - quit program
* `name of folder` - get into a folder


### Examples



## Built With

* [Boost 1.74](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_74_0.html)
